# Track and log

University project where a prototype needs to be implemented. This will serve a prototype in form of HTML documents. In addition to the visual representation of the prototype, some JavaScript will be inject to track every mouse and scroll movement, click events and other interesting parts. These will be send to a web server, that logs these as text logs, but also generates screen shots from the HTML that the user sees. The client will right before highlight the clicked
element.
